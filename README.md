# 3D Cloth Simulation

## Description
This project demonstrates a 3D cloth simulation using the Three.js library. The simulation replicates realistic cloth behavior such as deformation, stretching, and interaction with external forces. The project leverages physics-based principles, specifically Verlet integration, to model the behavior of cloth under gravity and user interaction.

## Features
- Realistic cloth deformation and stretching.
- Gravity-based physics simulation for cloth dynamics.
- Interactive mouse-driven influence on the clothâ€™s behavior.
- Camera controls using OrbitControls for better user interaction.
- Collision detection and response.
- Handles window resizing to maintain 3D rendering consistency.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following:
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
- Basic understanding of HTML and JavaScript.
- Internet connection to load the Three.js library from the CDN.

## Getting Started

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gaurav00321/cloth-simulation.git
   cd cloth-simulation
2. Open the index.html file in any modern web browser.

### Running the Project
1. Simply open the index.html file in a web browser to view the 3D cloth simulation.
2. Interact with the simulation using mouse movements to influence the cloth's behavior.

## Usage
- Mouse Interaction: Use your mouse to interact with the cloth, applying forces that influence its behavior.
- Camera Controls: Use the mouse to rotate, zoom, and pan around the scene to explore the 3D cloth simulation.
